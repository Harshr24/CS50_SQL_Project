# CS50 SQL Project – Complete Solutions

**GitHub Repository:** [CS50 SQL Project](https://github.com/Harshr24/CS50_SQL_Project)


**CS50’s Introduction to Databases with SQL** is a course offered by **Harvard University** that teaches the fundamentals of relational databases, including the use of SQL for managing and manipulating data. The course covers topics such as database design, relational algebra, normalization, and SQL queries.

This repository contains **complete solutions** for all the projects in the course. Each project is focused on solving real-world problems using SQL and database management techniques. The repository includes:

- Fully implemented SQL solutions to the problems provided in the course.
- Original problem statements in PDF format for reference.

This repository serves as both a **learning resource** for others and a **portfolio** showcasing my expertise in database management and SQL.
